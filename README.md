# Description:

This system was created to provide a simple and secure method of recording attendance. The software initially takes a picture of all of the authorised people and stores it in a database. The image is then stored by mapping it into a face coordinate structure by the system. Whenever a registered person enters the premises, the system recognises him and records his time and attendance.
